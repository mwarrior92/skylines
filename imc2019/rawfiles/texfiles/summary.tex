% SUMMARY
\subsection{Summary}

Although many naming conventions are in place, none directly indicate the amount of shared resources
between clients, and it is often taken for granted what clients sharing some label will have in
common. In this project, I measure the extent to which these conventions actually align with
careless assumptions regarding web resource allocation. I perform over 52 million comparisons
across more than 10,000 clients, and base our experiment in the context of real resolution sets
associated with popular webpages. Our preliminary findings show that the relationship between
existing grouping schemes and network resource exposure is nonintuitive, and that a new, direct
approach --- which I have coined the ``Skyline model" --- would help to resolve this.
