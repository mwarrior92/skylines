\section{Summary}

In this paper, we performed a large scale analysis of cross-domain DNS
redirection for 9,024 globally distributed clients. Our experiments spanned 
302 content hosting domains, shown to often coexist within the same popular web pages.
To quantify our findings, we introduced common network resource exposure, a
similarity measure that captures the extent to which clients are directed to the
same content resources. We validated CNRE as a necessary new measure by formally demonstrating that existing alternative labeling schemes fail to adequately
capture the same information.

Having established CNRE, we investigated the properties of high and low CNRE
measures between clients, and, from our findings, we derive CNRE \emph{clusters},
representative of aggregate content resource catchments. Finally, we have shown that a
client's geogrpahic relationship with its cluster's center is directly
proportional to that client's average performance across hundreds of domains. In
summary, our work in this project provides a baseline by which we can better
understand content resource allocation patterns, independent of the case specific
concerns of individual hosting implementations.
