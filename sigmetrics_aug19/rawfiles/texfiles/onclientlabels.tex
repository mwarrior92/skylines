\subsection{Client Labels}

A key contribution of this project is the observation that established client
labeling paradigms --- country, ASN, and BGP prefix --- fail to describe common
network resource exposure, especially at arbitrary levels of granularity. These
finds may warrant the introduction of a new, heirarchical labeling model to this
end. Related work demonstrated that there is much incentive to decouple
catchment labels from IP prefix matching systems, but failed to offer an
adequate and intuitive alternative client naming convention \cite{warrior2017drongo,benchaita2016stability}. We argue that this
project establishes CNRE as an appropriate basis for such a new convention.
Rather than arbtrarily building catchment groups and corresponding labels from
scratch, CNRE highlights \emph{existing} resource allocation trends, from which
appropriate insights can be drawn.
