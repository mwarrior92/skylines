\section{Cluster Analysis} \label{sect:analysis}

Now that we have built up an understanding of how CNRE behaves, we move on to
investigate the aggregate catchments of clients using clustering techniques
discussed in the previous section. In this section, we use the aforementioned
CNRE threshold of 0.73 for cluster formation. This threshold yields 870
clusters.  For analysis, in which we compare clients that cohabit the same
cluster, we consider only clusters for which the dataset has a representation of
at least three clients; this yields 612 clusters from the original 870. The
average cluster size from this reduced set is 15.78 members, with a standard
deviation of 9.0 and a median size of 14.19. Note that cluster size variety is
significantly impacted by the dataset, which has more client representation
in western Europe and North America than in the rest of the world where RIPE's
influence is more sparse \cite{ripe-atlas}.
