\subsection{Bettering Catchments}

In Section \ref{sect:analysis}, we exposed the existance of many clients that
likely experience poor mapping between themselves and content resources: the
groups with whom they share a high proportion of network resources are
physically much farther away than the centers of other groups that may offer the
unfortunate client better performance. In related work, researchers found that
many clients experience significantly lower latency toward a specific CDN by
simply posing as a member of a different subnet during DNS resolution \cite{warrior2017drongo}. While their results
are on a per-CDN scale, we propose that it may be possible to apply their
techniques \emph{across} providers to outlier clients discovered in this
project. Rather than identify an optimal alternative subnet for each CDN, it may
be the case that a client can choose a \emph{single} alternative subnet from an
aggregate catchment to use for all of its DNS resolution, across domains. We
leave in depth analysis of this potential avenue for future work.
