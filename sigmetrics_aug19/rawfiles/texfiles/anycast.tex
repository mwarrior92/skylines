\subsection{Anycast}
\label{anycast}

We opted for this project, as the first ever exploration of aggregate content
resource catchments, to focus on naturally occuring diversity in DNS redirection
across domains and clients. However, many large Internet platforms, although
serving from globally distributed points of presence, operate with as few as one
primary public IP address for all clients, regardless of the client's location
by employing \emph{anycast} techniques as opposed to DNS redirection for
server-to-client mapping \cite{Katabi:2000:FSG:347059.347388}. In anycast, a provider will advertise
different BGP route announcements for the same IP address in different regions.
While, in its current implementation, CNRE is dependent on differing DNS
answers, it is in some cases possible to distinguish differing anycast hosts
independently of their IP address \cite{anycast,fan2013evaluating,boothe2005dns}. With this approach, it would be trivial
to treat distinct anycast destinations in the same way as distinct IP answers,
enabling them to be incorporated into CNRE's calculation.
